Did you complete the homework to the origional requirements? If not, what's
still not finished?
Yes



What significant addition did you add to your new submission?
1. Add a waitpid(int pid, int * status) method. If pid > 0, this method will
wait specific process with pid, and if pid == -1, this method will wait any
child process.
2. For shell, add a .profile which contains directories. When run command, if
current directory dose not contain that binary file, sh will search that file
from those directories. For example, when in a /test directory with .profile
contain / directory and /bin directory, ls is not at there, so shell will find
if there is a /ls or there is a /bin/ls.
