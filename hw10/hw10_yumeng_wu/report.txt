1. The operating system, processor model, number of processor cores,
and amount of RAM for your local machine.

OS: mac OS X 10.15.3
Processor model: 2.3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5
Number of processor cores: 4
RAM: 8G

2. The operating system, processor model, number of processor cores,
and amount of RAM for the CCIS server.

Operating system: CentOS Linux 7
Processor model: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5118 CPU @ 2.30GHz
Number of processor cores: 48
RAM: 191694MB

3. A table of measured time and parallel speedup for each test

test                            measured time   parallel speedup
Local machine, 1 threads        11.208s         1
Local machine, 4 threads        11.328s         0.99
Local machine, 8 threads        13.789s         0.81
The CCIS server, 1 threads      11.268s         1
The CCIS server, 4 threads      8.318s          1.35
The CCIS server, 8 threads      9.612s          1.17

4. Two or three paragraphs discussing what results you got and why
you got them.

For local machine, we can see that there is no difference between
single thread and multi-threads. The reason may be although we have
multi threads, each thread would have more work, so the total time
is the same. And File I/O might be another reason.

5. Two or three paragraphs discussing the pros and cons of Rust as
an alternative to C for this sort of program.

pros:
Rust is much safer to handle memory.
cons:
C has a better performance.
C is much easier to write.
C has a better readability.
